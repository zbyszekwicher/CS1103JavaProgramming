This weather application uses the weatherstack API.

I only have the free access, so the forecast is not displaying fully.

However, the free access allows for an access to the information on current weather in any location.

To use this application type the city you want to search the weather information for.

Then click enter or the "search" button.

The weather information will be displayed in the middle.

If the city is not found (the input is invalid), the adequate message will be displayed instead.

At the bottom you can change the units. The changes will be visible after another search.

The search history will be visible on the right. Click the element to search the information again for this location.

Be aware that after the 18:00 the background will change to the sunset picture.
